## Project Overview

 [Deployed Front End](https://www.readrr.app/)

 [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/pfNUGgG3/betterreads)

 [Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/betterReads-66b5ba5a4c7e4036ab786e10b8c2de4d)

The aim of this project is to provide a clean, uncluttered user interface that allows a user to track books, in a similar fashion to something like GoodReads. More details can be found in the [product vision document](https://www.notion.so/Vision-Problem-Objectives-bb24ca087420443e8503115552bf4b25) (PVD accessible only to team members)

The core DS role on this project is to provide recommendations. If there are other DS utilties that you would like to add, communicate with Web, UI and iOS in order to get UI design input on the feature and identify the necessary data.

### Tech Stack

Currently, the application uses a simple nearest-neighbors-based search engine which funnels title matches into a system that references a cosine similarity matrix. The matrix is born out of a combination of collaborative and content based recommendation approaches. This method ultimately provides the best recommendations we have encountered to date. Unfortunately, the current data is limited to less than 10k books; in order to prevent empty recommendations where data for a book is non-existent, the hybrid engine falls back to a purely description-based recommendation wherever necessary. This means that there are _two_ recommendation engines working together to provide a seamless experience.

The hybrid engine is an aggregation of cosine similarities from a collaborative filtering method and a content-based one, using descriptions. Alternatively, the content-based system uses a combination of spacy for tokenization, tfidf for vectorization and a scikit-learn nearest-neighbors model to find the closest matches to a book in question.

All of these techniques are served to Web and iOS through a Flask application, with a gunicorn HTTP server, deployed inside of a Docker container to AWS elastic beanstalk.

### Data Sources

-   [10k Books, 6m Ratings](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k)
-   [Book Crossing Dataset](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/) (Mostly used for publishers to populate database)

### Connecting to the DS API

Currently, the domain for the data science API is [dsapi.readrr.app](https://dsapi.readrr.app)

The account used for the postman collection is the betterreadslabs21@gmail.com account (Sign in using google). See TL or SL for login credentials (you can also get login credentials for AWS, which the api is deployed on).
